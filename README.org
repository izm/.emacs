* dotemacs README

This is my personal emacs configuration, which anyone is free to use
and modify.  However, it is quite personalized, so would probably
require modification to use.  I also use it as a tool for learning and
playing around, so no promises are given on its state at any point.

It began as an =emacs-lisp= file called =.emacs= (hence the repository
name).  It is now a rich =org-mode= file that is processed by =emacs
org-mode= into the default =emacs= configuration file,
=~/.emacs.d/init.el= file.  When it does this, it overwrites the
existing =init.el= so be sure to back that up if you have one.

The file is [[file:init.org::*init.org][init.org]], which (like this README file) is conveniently
parsed by GitHub.
